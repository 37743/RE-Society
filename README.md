    The Mentor's Application facilitates mentorship programs for prisoners, allowing mentors to create profiles for them, update their resumes, and track their skill development.

- Web Application:

    the Web Application serves as a platform for both employers and ex-convicts. Employers can browse available services, choose the number of employees they need, and view recommended profiles and resumes without direct contact. Ex-convicts, on the other hand, can access job opportunities, receive skill training such as carpentry or blacksmithing, and ultimately reintegrate into society as productive members.
